# Integer Multiplication in n log n
Marcus Ã–stling

## Project plan
The purpose of this project is to a

### Decide on parameters (week 51)
The new algorithm have a couple on parameters that
I have to decide on. These parameters will be chosen
so that it is possible to run the algorithms on
8 GB of ram. Input sizes, output size, intermitiate results
and some space for the OS as well.

### Implement simple FFT multiplication (week 52)
Implement a simple FFT integer multiplication.
Given two integers, split them up into log n coefficients
for a polynomial, use FFT to multiply the polynomials,
convert back into one integer.

### Implement new algorithm (week 1-2)
Given two integers, split them up into log n coefficients
for a polynomial, 
use the algorithm given by the paper,
convert back into one integer.


### Run algorithms and compare (week 3)
Run both algorithms on the same inputs, up to large
integer (size will be decided during week 51), 
and measure their run-times.

### Run algorithms and compare (week 4)
All results should be done and I will write a complete report for the
project.
