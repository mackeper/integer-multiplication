<h3 id="decide-on-parameters-week-51">Decide on parameters (week 51)</h3>
<p>The new algorithm have a couple on parameters that
I have to decide on. These parameters will be chosen
so that it is possible to run the algorithms on
8 GB of ram. Input sizes, output size, intermitiate results
and some space for the OS as well.</p>
<h3 id="implement-simple-fft-multiplication-week-52">Implement simple FFT multiplication (week 52)</h3>
<p>Implement a simple FFT integer multiplication.
Given two integers, split them up into log n coefficients
for a polynomial, use FFT to multiply the polynomials,
convert back into one integer.</p>
<h3 id="implement-new-algorithm-week-1-2">Implement new algorithm (week 1-2)</h3>
<p>Given two integers, split them up into log n coefficients
for a polynomial, 
use the algorithm given by the paper,
convert back into one integer.</p>
<h3 id="run-algorithms-and-compare-week-3">Run algorithms and compare (week 3)</h3>
<p>Run both algorithms on the same inputs, up to large
integer (size will be decided during week 51).</p>
<h3 id="run-algorithms-and-compare-week-4">Run algorithms and compare (week 4)</h3>
<p>All results should be done and I will write a complete report for the
project. </p>
